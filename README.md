# School Web Scraper

Utility project for collecting data from Metro Nashville Public School websites. I intend to build a database of school data for parents and community members to use as a CRUD app. See https://github.com/tombler/UnChartered-Territory for in-progress project.

## Frameworks, Plugins and Other Dependencies

* NodeJS
* Express
* CheerioJS (for HTML parsing - https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio)
* Google Maps JavaScript API

## Usage

These scripts only work for specific school websites. In the future, I hope to open source the JSON files of this publicly available school data for the Nashville tech community to consume.
